    <h3 style="color: blue;">5. Group of selectors</h3>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. While space may appear before and/or after the comma.</p>
    <div style="border-left: 8px solid yellowgreen; padding-left: 10px; background-color: beige; padding: 5px;">
        <h3>CSS example: </h3>
        <p>
            In this example, we condense three rules with indentical declarations into one. Thus,
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                h1 { front - family: sans-serif} <br>
                h2 { front - family: sans-serif} <br>
                h3 { front - family: sans-serif}
            </p>
            <p>
                is equivalent to:
            </p>
            <p>
                h1, h2, h3 { front - family: sans-serif} 
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
